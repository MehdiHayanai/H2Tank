Title: Genetic Algorithm for Optimizing the Resistance of Hydrogen Tanks

Description: This project contains a genetic algorithm implementation in Python for optimizing the resistance of hydrogen tanks used in cars that are pressurized with 700 bars and need to resist a burst test of 1750 bars. Hydrogen tanks are essential components in many applications that rely on hydrogen fuel cells, and their resistance is a critical factor in determining their safety and durability. The genetic algorithm works by iteratively generating and evaluating populations of candidate solutions (genetic individuals) and selecting the best individuals for reproduction through genetic operators like crossover and mutation. The fitness of each individual is determined by simulating the tank's resistance under various conditions using a physics-based model that calculates the stress in each layer of the tank. The genetic algorithm is implemented using an object-oriented approach, with classes for the individual, population, and genetic algorithm.
By using this genetic algorithm, we aim to find optimal hydrogen tank designs that maximize resistance while minimizing weight and cost.
